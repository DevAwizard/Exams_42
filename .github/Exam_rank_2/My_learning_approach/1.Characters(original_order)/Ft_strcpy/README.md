Reproduce the behavior of the function strcpy (man strcpy).

Your function must be declared as follows:

char    *ft_strcpy(char *s1, char *s2);
```


### Man strcpy

The  strcpy()  function  copies  the  string  pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte ('\0'), to the buffer pointed to by dest.  The strings may not overlap, and the  destination  string dest must be large enough to receive the copy.  Beware of buffer overruns!  (See BUGS.)

The strcpy() functions return a pointer to the destination string dest.
