### Exam Details 🧐

- The exam consists of 2 random questions: either **`printf`** 🖨️ or **`get_next_line`** 📝.

- If you fail the exam, you can retake the same exercise. 

- Each **`grademe`** will increase the amount of time for the next attempt. ⏳

- **No Norminette** rules are applied.


## My Personal Approach

I start by writing down the exercise and reviewing the relevant subjects (printf or gnl). I then refresh my knowledge on the key concepts needed for each topic. 

For printf 🖨️, I focus on variadic functions and conversion specifiers. 


For get_next_line 📝, I concentrate on file handling, buffers, and the static variable. 

This structured review helps me prepare effectively for the exam.
