### Exam Details 🧐

- The exam consists of 2 random questions: either **`printf`** 🖨️ or **`get_next_line`** 📝.

- If you fail the exam, you can retake the same exercise. 

- Each **`grademe`** will increase the amount of time for the next attempt. ⏳

- **No Norminette** rules are applied.


## My Personal Approach

I start by writing down the exercise and reviewing the relevant subjects (printf or gnl). I then refresh my knowledge on the key concepts needed for each topic. 

For printf 🖨️, I focus on variadic functions and conversion specifiers. 


For get_next_line 📝, I concentrate on file handling, buffers, and the static variable. This structured review helps me prepare effectively for the exam.

Here are the steps: 

1. Go to the exam, write down the exercise.

2. Go to the printf or/and gnl subject.

3. Remember what it consists of.

4. Relearn the concepts of printf and gnl.

  - Printf Concepts 🖨️
    - Function prototype: int ft_print(char const*, ...);
    - va_start
    - va_arg
    - va_end
    - Conversion specifiers: %d, %c, %s, %x (Consider looking for more conversion specifiers if needed)

  - Get next line concepts 📝
    - Prototype function: char *get_next_line(int fd)
    - read
    - Buffer size
    - Static variable
    - fd (file descriptor)
    - Open file
    - Close file
    - free
    - Buffer
